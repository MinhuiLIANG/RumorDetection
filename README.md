# Multimodel Fake News Detection
This is the code related to my BSC graduation thesis.
* The data include 3 dicts: `weibo`, `datas`, and `vocab`, placing them in the root directory is fine.
* Please run `train.py` directly if data are ready.
* During the training process, dictionary `models` will be generated with models of each epoch in the root directory of this project.
* File `testModel` can be utilized to check the performance of the models, change `path` in line 29 to select the model you are interested in.
